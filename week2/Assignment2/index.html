    <h2>"My Bio"</h2>
    <img src="images/image.jpeg" alt="Selfie">
    <p>My name is Randy Lora. I am currently attending New England Institute of Technology. I am a huge fan of TV, Movies & Video Games (especially God of War). I was born in Providence, Rhode Island on June 25, 2001. I have been playing video games since the days of the Nintendo GameCube. My favorite game console is the PlayStation 2 because it brought me some of the greatest experiences in my life with friends I'm still close to till this day.</p>
